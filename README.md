# To-Do-List-Program
*Still in Progress* -- This program will allow the user to create, update and delete to do list items from a to do list they have created. The items will have a start date and a due date, as well as an urgency label to specify the priority of the task. This data will be stored in a excel or csv formatted file on the user's local machine.
